* `string` - Either the name of a single column or a comma separated list of
columns inside of the string. Each identifier group is automatically escaped and
wrapped in backticks (or equivalent). Dots are separated out to denote the
`DATABASE.COLUMN` syntax and are wrapped properly as ``DATABASE`.`COLUMN``.
